                <h2>Who are you?</h2>
                <p>My name is Felix Lindblom and I come from roughly Gothenburg Sweden. At this point of time I'm 19 years old and will turn 20 in February. Before coming here to Jönköping I study tech at Nti johanneberg where I study a lot of coding courses. </p>

                <h2>Why are you studying <strong>NMD</strong>?</h2>
                <p>I have chosen NMD to be a front-end developer as I found it on Nti johanneberg to be the most fun coding. NMD has as well not too much math which I don't want to read it 24/7. </p>

                <h2>What are you hobbies?</h2>
                <p>I change a lot on my hobbies, but I have always had paint and scouting as one of my main hobbies. But one of the latest are making my own keyboard, which I have 3 off as of now. 2 of the keyboards even has a Ansi layout which means they have American layout. Ansi layout are much easier to code on. </p>
